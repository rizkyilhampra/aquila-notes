# Laravel Inertia Resources

Here are some resources to take a look at when working with Laravel and Inertia.js (especially with React.js by this time i wrote).

- [laravel-query-builder](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-query-builder/v5)
  > Provides a way to build query. It also provides a way to filter, sort, and also include the relationship data.
- [laravel-json-api-paginate](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-json-api-paginate)
  > Provides a way to paginate the data in a more JSON-API way.
- [laravel-data](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-data/v4) or an especially page about data passing through inertia on [advanced usage using inertia](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-data/v4/advanced-usage/use-with-inertia)
  > an Data Object stuff (DTO pattern). By this time i wrote, it provides me an transformation stuff (also for Typescript interface/definition), and also a way to pass data to the view (especially in this case, inertia) in a more structured way.
