## Whatsapp Official API
### Needs to verified business portfolio first to able work with the test number
I tho earlier at [[dailies/2025-11-19#Still unable to make the test number working to actually send message|2025-11-19]] it's need to update payment method first for able to work, but seems not correct too. I have tried send an template message from test number to my defined phone number and success after the business it's verified.
### Sucks of verifying business
After do research especially i found an like workaround to like 'hack' the business verifying process on Reddit (forgot where the sub is). Yes i able to verifying after doing modified like legal business statement. My business or like where at i am working on it's only have landline, there is no phone number that connect or had Whatsapp. So how do i able get verification code? Yes there is an option to make Meta call the number, but I did not receive anything from it. Don't ask me how many i have tried. I do have severall option too, verifiying by adding TXT record on my business domain, emailing with suffix `@business_domain.com` and neither is work. It's still need verification code again and again. How sucks it is!
