# Whatsapp Official API
## Need to use facebook account
For doing able registered to Meta developer platform (which is needs to able like using Whatsapp Official API things ones) it's needs to have a facebook account for creating an Business Portfolio, which an personal ones (cause the Meta doesn't have like for business ones).
### Get restricted account
I have restricted account cause have setup in the past about ads, i can't do anything with my main account ones. So i do need to create an another ones, but it's suck. I can't have creat anything, i do have several email and also i do try with my company email ones, nothing it's successful. After tried with an mobile number ones (same as my main account) now it's successful. What a sucks ones for Meta, can't able create multiple account same like Instagram did.
