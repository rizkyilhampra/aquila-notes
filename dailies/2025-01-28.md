## Replaced Swap Disk with ZRAM

### Why

Using Swap Disk I think it caused me an random freeze. So I decided to try out [ZRAM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zram) instead with replaced it.

### Removed Swap Disk

Since I'm using ZRAM, I don't need swap disk anymore. So I removed the swap partition from my disk. Before, I want to disable only, with following this [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Swap#Disabling_swap) and [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Swap#Swap_file_removal) but it's only do temporary. It's still show up when ran `swapon --show`. After I removed with GParted, then used the unused space to root filesystem, now it be able to fully removed or turn off the swap disk.

### Configure ZRAM

I configure ZRAM using [zram-generator](https://github.com/systemd/zram-generator). It's need create a file called `/etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf` and then enabled/started it with systemd. After so much try and error, here is what's `zram.conf` looks like:

```ini
[zram0]
zram-size = min(ram / 2, 4096)
compression-algorithm = lz4

[zram1]
zram-size = 1024
compression-algorithm = lz4
fs-type = ext4
mount-point = /tmp
```
### Optimized with Kernel Parameters
After seeing [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zram#Optimizing_swap_on_zram), I added the following kernel parameters in `/etc/sysctl.d/99-vm-zram-parameters.conf`:

```ini
vm.swappiness = 120
vm.watermark_boost_factor = 10000
vm.watermark_scale_factor = 50
vm.page-cluster = 3
```
