## Unable to connect or mount phone device

Based on following this [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/File_manager_functionality#Mounting) it needs to be installed `gvfs-mtp` and `gvfs-gphoto2`, then it will show up the phone device, in my case on nautilus.

## Change network driver

### Why

Recently i got some weird issue with ethernet cable. It's need me to reload after 10-20 minutes to get working. If I won't to do that, it will cause slow connection or unable to ping any domains.

### Start

Today i do searching again, then found this [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Network_configuration/Ethernet#Realtek_RTL8111/8168B) it's told me that there is some issue with `r8169` module or in this mean an driver I used. We can seeing what's the module or network driver being use by run [[cheatsheets/Check Network Driver Used|this]]. After I know I used that driver, then I try to install `r8168` through AUR by it's suggestion by do;

```bash
yay -S r8168
```

After that you should see the `r8168` module is detected from initframfs by do;

```bash
mkinitcpio -M | rg r8168
```

Then it's tell me to blacklist the `r1689` module.

### Blacklist module

It's need me to create `.conf` file under `/etc/modprobe.d`

```bash
sudo touch /etc/modprobe.dh/modprobe.conf
```

Which the content of the file it's looks like this

```conf
blacklist r8169
```

Then we need to regenerate the initramfs image.

### Regenerate initramfs

```bash
sudo mkinitcpio -p linux
```

> `linux` is the kernel I used then it's acting as an preset when regenerate the image.

### Ensure

We could run below for graping if it's the module are already listed.

```bash
mkinitcpio -v | rg r8168
```

Then do reboot, and check again by run [[cheatsheets/Check Network Driver Used|this]]

Here is the output what's should be when it's succesfull move out to `r8168`
