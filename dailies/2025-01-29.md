## Unable to connect or mount phone device
Based on following this [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/File_manager_functionality#Mounting) it needs to be installed `gvfs-mtp` and `gvfs-gphoto2`, then it will show up the phone device, in my case on nautilus. 
## Change network driver
### Why
Recently i got some weird issue with ethernet cable. It's need me to reload after 10-20 minutes to get working. If I won't to do that, it will cause slow connection or unable to ping any domains.
### Start
Today i do searching again, then found this [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Network_configuration/Ethernet#Realtek_RTL8111/8168B) it's told me that there is some issue with `r8169` module or in this mean an driver. First of all i try to install `r8168` through AUR by it's suggestion. Then it's tell me to blacklist the `r1689` module. 
#### Blacklist module
