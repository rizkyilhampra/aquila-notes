Kita mulai dari suatu cerita proses interview di suatu RS swasta di "40 menit dari domisili". i do some test dan wawancara. interview dengan HR dan User. start dri jam 9.10 sampai jam 11.40, 2 jam berjalan normal smpai pada ketika orng orngn called an IT programmer being "interviewed" me. That's the horrible interview i've into it.

how's arrogant he is interviewed me. i've never seen any respect from him exclude called by "mas". how do f this guy passed "psikologi" stuff when he applied first time. that's the terrible attitude that shouldn't had by professional worker. that's so different between an pure HR and User. i don't know why this guy is doing not related job desc as he an programmer and also not as a senior/"jabatan fungsional"

kea tolong lah para interviewer "perusahaan", kita sama2 butuh ga sih. lu nyari kandidat yang cocok dan kompeten. ya gua apply untuk mengisi posisi itu. gua tahu proses recruitment itu butuh waktu dan biaya yang g sdikit. jadi ya maksimalin gak sih, buat kandidat merasa "keanya boleh deh disini" dibanding dpet hasil YTTA ya kan

last. if you know what place that i mention, you are an IT related stuff, and you need job. do not apply. take my word. "lingkungan kerja" it's main priority, man. kcuali dpet offer gede, yaudah, minusnya di tekanan. tpi klo udh offer YTTA, lingkungan YTTA, dhlah
