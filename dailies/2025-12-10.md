# 2025 12 10
So here is my tho after skipped some days maybe week (?) 
## Menjadi orang terpilih
Sesuai judul, I am going to be an like 'relawan' for 'acara kemanusiaan/agama'. Not by my own decide or willingly to approach that, instead chosen by SK. Yep Surat Keputusan dari Direktur where do I worked. I know seems good and humanize and absolutely gave 'pahala', but did you know I can be sort of like believe the 'mie' (yes the noodles) is god? Oh fuck, gua ga bakal tau gimana nantinya. Yes for like professionalism and the who's chosen which gua punya tanggung jawab, I will sure to do my best. I am just confuse, did sort of something like this it's needs to be chosen? Why not like find people or someone who's purely willing to do it than force someone (without had like 'tawaran' before) to had that 'tanggung jawab'?! The like 'judul' it's basically from 'koordinator lapangan' which is mean he are the like 'ketua' for this event. I don't remember what's basically did he said, but like the point is, "Selamat kalian adalah orang yang terpilih", yes 'terpilih', not from anywhere or basicallly like 'mukjizat' but by you are fucking people chosen me!
