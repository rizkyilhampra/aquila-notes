# Agile

One of the [[1728529486-software-development-life-cycle|Software Development Life Cycle]] methodology. It's involves breaking the project into phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration and improvement with follow a cycle of planning, executing, and evaluating.

Whereas the traditional "waterfall" approach has one discipline contribute to the project, then "throw it over the wall" to the next contributor, agile calls for collaborative cross-functional teams. Open communication, collaboration, adaptation, and trust among team members are at the heart of agile.

Teams choose agile so they can respond to changes in the marketplace or feedback from customers quickly without derailing a year's worth of plans. "Just enough" planning and shipping in small, frequent increments lets your team gather feedback on each change and integrate it into future plans at minimal cost. [^1]
