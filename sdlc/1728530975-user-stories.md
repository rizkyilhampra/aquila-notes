# User Stories

> A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. It's purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.[^1]

Is an unit of work in an [[1728527572-agile|Agile]] framework. I'ts an end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user's perspective.

In [[1728527555-scrum|Scrum]], user stories are added to the [[1728528769-sprints|Sprints]] and "burned down" over the duration of the sprint. Otherwise in [[1728531469-kanban|Kanban]], teams pull user stories into their [[1728531496-backlog|Backlog]] and run them through their workflow.

User stories are also the building blocks of larger agile frameworks like [[1728531579-epics|epics]] and initiatives.
