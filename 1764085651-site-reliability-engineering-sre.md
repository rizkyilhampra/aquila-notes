> So, I want to write this because I have found in Facebook post have talk about that, and I did not know what was that before, so wanted to learn it too. 
## Definition
By Amazon (AWS), SRE is the practice of using software tools to automate IT infrastructure tasks such as system management and application monitoring.[^aws] It's really related with SLAs, SLIs, and SLOs. 

SRE will help software development team with providing metrics, logs, and traces as a part of observability. Process of observing the predefined metric it's monitoring. Monitoring when it is related with SRE is collect critical information that reflects the system performance. Metrics thats SRE monitor it's  by developer decide which parameter is critical in determining health of application. It's include latency, traffic, errros, and saturation which help to gain insight into system reliability itself. 

SRE it's basically practical implementation of DevOps.
