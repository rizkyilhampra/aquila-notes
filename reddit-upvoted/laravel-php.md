# Laravel / PHP

## https://github.com/skywarth/chaotic-schedule

Chaotic Schedule allows you to randomize command schedule intervals using pseudo-random number generators (pRNGs). This means your Laravel commands can run at random times within boundaries set by you. It's like rolling dice for your task scheduler!
