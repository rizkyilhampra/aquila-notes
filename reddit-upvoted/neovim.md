# Neovim

## [neovim-project](https://github.com/coffebar/neovim-project)

**Neovim project** plugin simplifies project management by maintaining project history and providing quick access to saved sessions via [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) or [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua). It runs on top of the [Neovim Session Manager](https://github.com/Shatur/neovim-session-manager), which is needed to store all open tabs and buffers for each project.

- ‚úÖ Start where you left off last time.
- ‚úÖ Switch from project to project in second.
- ‚úÖ Sessions and history can be synced across your devices (rsync, Syncthing, Nextcloud, Dropbox, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Find all your projects by glob patterns defined in config.
- ‚úÖ Autosave **neo-tree.nvim** expanded directories and buffers order in **barbar.nvim**.
- ‚úÖ Choose your favorite picker.
