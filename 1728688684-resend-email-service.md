# Resend(email service)

One of production email service i used. Is also one of email driver at laravel. Yes, you can send email out of the box with this, cause it support Laravel. If similar lain mailpit and mailgun (i think). The best of this(resend), it has intuitive UI, it is built from owner who has built vercel, and that's why the UI if abosolutely amazing)
